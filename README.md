# Reproducibility and Communication Using Notebooks (Jupyter (python) & R)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/161496152.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/161496152)

This workshop will will provide a hands-on introduction to the notebook environments that are available for the R (RMarkdown & RNotebooks in RStudio) and python (Jupyter Notebooks) programming languages in support of enhanced reproducibility and communication of analytic processes and results. We will gain hands-on experience with Markdown (a shared simple markup language that is common to both notebook environments) and the strategies for working in both RMarkdown and Jupyter notebooks to produce well documented and executable notebooks that can easily be shared with others, either for execution, or as documents for communication of your analysis and results.   


To participate in the workshop (which we strongly recommend) you will need to install the R programming language (available for free download from here: https://cran.r-project.org), the free RStudio Desktop open source IDE (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and a recent release of the Anaconda python (currently python version 3.8 - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) environment.  These installations will provide you with both notebook environments and their associated languages that we will be demonstrating in this workshop.

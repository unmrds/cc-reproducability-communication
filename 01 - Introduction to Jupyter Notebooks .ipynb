    "The notebook model for building interactive documents that combine text and executable content has been around since at least 1988 when *Mathematica* was released with its notebook interface that combined descriptive text and executable blocks of code. Since then many analytic tools have been developed that use the notebook model for combining descriptive text (comments and notes) with executable code. The distinguishing characteristic of Jupyter notebooks (and its predacessor iPython notebook) is the delivery of the notebook interface through a web application that significantly increases the portability of the notebooks as they can easily be rendered in static form through  systems such as [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org) and GitHub, and in an interactive form through locally running notebook servers (based on a local installer or Docker container), hosted platforms such as  [Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks](https://docs.anaconda.com/ae-notebooks/4.0/index.html), [CoCalc](https://doc.cocalc.com), or even in a platform that you can roll for yourself in the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How can you get it for yourself?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways for getting the needed software components that are required for a locally hosted Jupyter Notebook server. A commonly recommended approach is to install [*Anaconda*](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) which will provide you with a self-contained installation of Python, the Jupyter Notebook and a bunch of other packages that you might find helpful in doing your analyses. If Python is not your language of choice, there are over [88 other kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) representing alternative languages that you can integrate into the Jupyter notebook interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can I see some examples of Jupyter Notebook in action?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are showing up in a lot of places, but some great collections of notebooks (both Jupyter and the older iPython flavors) are found in a few galleries:\n",

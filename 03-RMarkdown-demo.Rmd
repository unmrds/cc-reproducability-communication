# R Markdown and R

## Abstract

*keywords*: markdown, RStudio, R, literate computing

## R Markdown Tips

* [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf?_ga=2.40279330.1638453532.1646345902-486230548.1646345902)

R Markdown files are written and compiled into the target export format in a two step process. While in Jupyter notebooks you can render individual cells of Markdown text by "executing" them, with R Markdown you develop your R Markdown document and then render the whole document into one or more output files.

R Markdown files are broken into chunks of Markdown and executable code, with the code code starting  with ```` ```{r}```` and ending with ```` ``` ````. The language that should be used to interpret the code chunk (R in our case) is provided in the `{}`. In RStudio you can manually type in the start and end elements of a code chunk, or use the apprpriate keyboard shortcut for your operating system (option-command-I on the Mac).

You can execute individual lines of R code or individual code blocks without rendering the whole document. 

* *command-enter* (Mac) to execute the current line of code or the selected lines of code
* *command-shift-enter* (Mac) to execute the current chunk/block of code

Here is a sample code block in which three mathematical calculations are performed (including a comment that highlights that commenting within code blocks is a good practice)

```{r}
# Use comments to add text or descriptive info to a code cell.

196 * 786527
261876 / 19871987
3**88
```

```{r}
# using print functions instead of default output for calculation results

print(196 * 786527)
print(261876 / 19871987)
print(3**88)
```

*How is the output of these two variations on the calculation different from the output from the comparable calculations in the Jupyter Notebook?*

> **R Markdown rendering of code chunks is line by line, with the default behavior of displaying first the R command and then the output of that command as output blocks in the editor, and output cells in the generated output file**

You can modify this default behavior by using options in the start of the code chunk:

the `echo=FALSE` option:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Show only the output, not the commands that generated the output using the "echo=FALSE" option

196 * 786527
261876 / 19871987
3**88
```

the `collapse=TRUE` option:

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
# Collapse the input and output into a single output cell with the "collapse=TRUE" option

196 * 786527
261876 / 19871987
3**88
```

the `results=hide` option:

```{r, results='hide'}
# Just show the source code without the output using the "results='hide'" option

196 * 786527
261876 / 19871987
3**88
```

combining the `results=hide, echo=FALSE` options: ![](images/invisible-g3fab53516_640.png){ height=150px }

```{r, results='hide', echo=FALSE}
# Don't display either the source code or output by combining the "results='hide'" and "echo=FALSE" options

196 * 786527
261876 / 19871987
3**88
```



### Variables and Sequence of Execution

Like Jupyter notebooks the sequence of execution controls the values of R objects at any time in your work with your R Markdown document. **But**, when you `knit` your R Markdown document into a rendered file, the source document is always executed anew from beginning to end, ignoring any changes you have made by executing individual lines or chunks of code. 

### Inserting R Variables and Code in Markdown Blocks

One powerful capability that R Markdown provides is the insertion of values of R variables or the output of R commands into Markdown chunks. 

```{r}
# Assigning output to variables

a <- 196 * 786527
b <- 261876 / 19871987
c <- 3**88

```

Insertion of values associated with variables or executing R code within Markdown chunks is done by placing the variable or R code into an embedded execution block within your Markdown. The execution block is wrapped in back-tick characters (`` ` ``) and start with the language interpreter that should be used. For example `` ` `` r 2+3 `` ` `` (without the space before the `r`) which is rendered as: `r 2+3`. 

Embedding R variables follows this model as well as with:

* Variable `a` = `r a`
* Variable `b` = `r b`
* Variable `c` = `r c`

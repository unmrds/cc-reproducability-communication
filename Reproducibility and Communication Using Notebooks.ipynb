    "> According to a U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) subcommittee on replicability in science [Bollen et al., 2015], \"reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator ...\" Documenting this kind of reproducibility thus requires, at a minimum the **sharing of analytical datasets** (original or processed data), **relevant metadata**, **analytical code**, and **related software**. (emphasis added)\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration of executable code with blocks of narrative content within notebook systems such as those provided in RStudio and the Jupyter Notebook (and Lab) software environments provides a streamined way to bring these minimum components (data, metadata, code, and software) into a package that can be easily shared with others for review and reuse. \n",

    "1. A high-level introduction to the notebook interfaces provides for R and Python through the RStudio and Jupyter Notebook environments. \n",
    "2. An introduction to Markdown as a language supported by both systems for adding narrative content to notebooks\n",
    "3. Output options from both platforms for sharing the contents of your notebooks"

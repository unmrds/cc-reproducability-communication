# Example Lab Report

Reports in APA style include the following sections:

1. Title page
2. Abstract
	1. Keywords after abstract
3. Introduction
4. Methods
5. Results
6. Discussion
7. References

Some elements of APA formatting are beyond the scope of this workshop, for example centering section headers and double spacing text. For this exercise, we will adhere to the structure of an APA style report, as well as use Markdown syntax to add emphsasis, lists, and tables.

## Exercise: Title Page

Create a title page using either of the title block and metadata methods that were demonstrated to create a title page with the following info:

Title: Coffe and Code - Markdown
Author: your name
Date: today's date

## Exercise: Abstract

1. Create an abstract section of the lab report, using a level two header for "Abstract." 
2. Type in a few lines of text.
3. Use a new paragraph to add keywords. The first word of the paragraph should be "Keywords," in italic font.

## Exercise: Body

1. Use level two headers to create the remaining sections of the report.
2. Add some placeholder text to each section.
3. In the "Methods" section, use level three headers to add subsections for "Data Collection" and "Analysis."
4. In the "Discussion" section, use level three headers to add a subsection for "Limitations."


We note that APA formatting for references is also outside of the scope of this workshop.

It is also possible to add inline images and tables to Markdown documents. However, for the purposes of this workshop much of the advantage of using Markdown in combination with R and Python code in R Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks is to streamline the inclusion of analyses, figures, tables, etc. So let's dive into those applications!
